What is a Convolutional Neural Network?
It a type of deep learning model specialized for processing grid-like data,
primarily images and videos, by automatically learning hierarchical patterns
from low-level features (edges, corners) to high-level concepts (objects, faces).

Architecture of a CNN:
    1. Input Image(s) -> Target images we'd like to discover patterns in
    2. Input Layer -> Takes in target images and preprocesses them for further layers
    3. Convolution Layer -> Extracts/learns the most important features from target images
    4. Hidden Activation -> Adds non-linearity to learned features (non-straight lines)
    5. Pooling Layer -> Reduces the dimensionality of learned image features
    6. Fully Connected Layer -> Further refines learned features from convolutional layers
    7. Output Layer -> Takes learned features and outputs them in shape of target labels
    8. Output Activation -> Adds non-linearities to output layer

A CNN is typically a stack of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and non-linear activations all jumbled together.
